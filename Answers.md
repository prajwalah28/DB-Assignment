1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Ans:
the "Product" entity and the "Product_Category" entity have a relationship defined by the "product_category" id foreign key in the "Product" entity. This indicates that a product is associated with a specific product category, which is identified by a unique "id" in the "Product_Category" entity. Therefore, we can say that a "Product" entity has a one-to-many relationship with the "Product_Category" entity, as one product category can have many products associated with it.


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it
Ans:
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can create a foreign key constraint in the "Product" table that references the primary key of the "Category" table. This way, each product in the "Product" table will have a corresponding category in the "Category" table. Here is an example of how you can create the foreign key constraint:

ALTER TABLE Product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
REFERENCES Category(category_id);

In this example, I am assuming that the "Product" table has a column named "category_id" that is used to reference the "Category" table. You will need to replace "category_id" with the actual column name in your "Product" table that references the "Category" table.

Additionally, you can set up the database to automatically set the category_id column to NULL or to take NO ACTION when a row in the "Category" table is deleted or updated. This will depend on your specific requirements and how you want the database to behave in such cases.

By creating this foreign key constraint, you can ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, and if a category is deleted or updated, you can specify how the database should behave.
